## Application

[**WA1**](Application_Part1.md#wa1)

What does the example presented in Ludwin et al. 2005 say about the value that the sciences have historically attributed to traditional knowledge in when it comes to understanding our world? 

<!-- The sciences have tended to have a bias against and non-white/colonial/male knowledge/sources -->

[**WA2**](Application_Part1.md#wa2)

Look back at Ludwin et al. 2005, specifically at the story of Pachena Bay (bottom pg 142 to top of pg 143).  You can find a [full transcription here](https://pnsn.org/outreach/native-american-stories/other-stories/the-tsunami-at-anaqtl-a-or-pachena-bay).  Find Pachena Bay on google maps.  Where is it relative to Port Alberni?  What can you infer from this story about how a megathrust earthquake occurring just off of the coast of Vancouver Island would impact Port Alberni? 

<!-- The whole village was destroyed.  Only ppl up high on the hill survived.  The bay has a shorter but similar shape to the alberni inlet.  An equivalent earthquake would be VERY bad. -->

[**WA3**](Application_Part5.md#wa3)


Write a brief (1 page) report for the City of Port Alberin.  The report needs explicity answer the four questions questions:

**1**{: .label .label-red } Which roads are at risk of flooding or damage?

**2**{: .label .label-red } Which properties in the city are at risk?

**3**{: .label .label-red } How many people in Port Alberni are potentially living in areas at risk?

**4**{: .label .label-red } Are the Tsunami Shelters sufficient?


You should briefly summarize the analysis steps you used to conduct the Tsunami Risk Assessment and explain your findings referring to your charts, map, statistics where necessary.

<!-- Needs to explain results & answer each question (see above^) (10 pts - 2 each) + introduction/summary of problem (5pts) + explain steps (5pts)-->
