# Looking at the Relationships

Now that we've classified the data, lets look for some patterns.  The video instructions below use the old Rural/Urban classification as an example.  In the video I show you how to create **Bar Charts** and **Box Plots**.  These are two useful tools for learning more about our data.  Use the video guide below to create:

1) A **Bar Chart** showing the total population by Population Centre and Rural Area Classification

2) A **Box Plot** of Income_on_Food by Population Centre and Rural Area Classification

### QA 

In which Population Centre and Rural Area class does the the largest proportion of BC's population live?

### QA

What proportion of BC's overall population lives in Rural Areas?   (Round to the nearest tenth)  *Hint* Sum the four classes to get the total population.

<!-- 29.0 -->

### QA

What is the median percentage of their income people in Rural areas spend on food?  (Round to the nearest tenth)

<!-- 17.2 -->

### QA 

Which Population Centre and Rural Area class displays the greatest variability?

# Stylizing Your Visualizations

Watch the video bellow for tips on how to stylize your charts before submitting them.  You can use [Color Brewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Paired&n=3) to make sure you use a color scheme that is accessible.

### FA1

Submit your Bar Chart and Box Plot to Canvas.

### WA

Create Scatter Plot with Population Density on the X-Axis and Income_on_Food on the Y axis.  Does the r2 score indicate a relationship?  How does classifying the data help us reveal patterns we cant easily see in this chart?
