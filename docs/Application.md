# Using Data Classification to Visualize Patterns: The Rural Urban Divide

## Learning Objectives:

* Use Simply Analytics to download census data
* Apply different data classification methods
* Practice creating effective visualizations

## Research Question

There are distinct social, political, and economic differences between Urban and Rural communities in BC.  Today we are going to investigate if there is a difference in the cost of food in Rural and Urban areas.  Specifically, portion of their income people spend on food.   We are going to define Rural and Urban based on total population **and** population density.
