# Spatial Data Models


There are two main types of spatial data models: the **Raster** and **Vector** models.  The raster data model represents spatial data as grid of cells, and each cell has one non-spatial attribute associated with it.  The vector data model represents spatial data as either points, lines, or polygons that are each linked to one or more non-spatial attributes.  These two models represent the world in fundamentally different ways.  One is not inherently better than the other, but they are better suited for different circumstances.  The choice of which model to use is often dictated by three main factors:

**1)** The  type of phenomena we are trying to represent.

**2)** The scale at which we plan to analyze our data.

**3)** How we plan to use the data.
