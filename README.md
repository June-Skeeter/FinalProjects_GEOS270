<!-- 

- As listed here, the analysis steps will not yield your desired results

- Consider how the resolution of the available data may impact your results

- Consider changing the scale of your project

- Consider incorporating Vancouver park layer to map green space

- Simply Analytics does not have properties data (try city of Vancouver database)

- Consider incorporating more population factors eg. demographics, income, expenditure on housing (to gauge property value) etc.

- Failed to signup for group - Groups are used to auto assign grades.  All members **must** sign up for a group to receive their grade.

- Landslides tend to happen in the wet season (Fall/Winter/Spring)

- This is a bit too simple for a final project.
	- You could make it more robust by comparing multiple demographic groups and comparing different cities
